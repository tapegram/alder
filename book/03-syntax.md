# 3. Syntax

## Files and modules

One module per file. The first line names the module, and the module name
is the file path: `Todos.Index` lives in `app/Todos/Index.alder`.

```alder fragment
module Todos.Index

import Todo
import Layout
```

`import X` brings module `X` into scope as a qualified name: `X.foo`,
`X.SomeType`, `<X.Component>`. There are no unqualified imports and no
renaming. Modules from the standard library (`List`, `Text`, `Db`, ...) are
always in scope and never imported.

A declaration whose name equals the last segment of its module's name is
referred to by the module name alone: module `Todo` defining `type Todo` (or
`table Todo`) is used as `Todo`, not `Todo.Todo`; module `Layout` defining a
component `Layout` is used as `<Layout>`.

**Pages and app-level messages are global.** A page value (`Todos.Show { id:
id }`), an app-level message (`App.Logout`), and their type `App.Msg` can be
used from any module without an import. Everything else a module uses must
be imported, and imports may not form a cycle.

**Constructors are never qualified.** If `Todo` defines `type Priority = Low
| Normal | High`, a module that imports `Todo` writes `Normal`, not
`Todo.Normal`, while the type is still `Todo.Priority`. Constructor names
must therefore be unique across a module's imports and the standard library;
a clash is a compile error.

Everything a module defines is visible to other modules, with one exception:
a brand's constructor (see chapter 4). There is no `export` list.

## Names

Names are letters, digits and `_`. A name that starts with a lowercase
letter or `_` is a value, a field or a type parameter; one that starts with
an uppercase letter is a type, a constructor, a module or a component. A
name may not contain two underscores in a row (`max__len` is an error), and
a module name segment may not end with `_`: the compiler joins the parts of
the Go names it generates with `__` (chapter 13), so these are the names it
keeps for itself.

In a page module and in `App`, the compiler also generates the types
`Params`, `Msg`, `Session` and, for each `msg Pick`, `PickParams`. A type,
table, form or component of yours may not take one of those names (E0012).

## Comments

```alder
-- A line comment. There are no block comments.
```

## Declarations

A module is a list of declarations. Order does not matter; a declaration can
refer to one defined later in the file.

```alder
-- Value with a type signature. The signature is required.
greeting : Text
greeting = "hello"

-- Function. Parameters are written after the name.
add : Int -> Int -> Int
add a b = a + b

-- Type (chapter 4)
type Filter = All | Active | Completed

-- Page, msg, form, table, capability, test (later chapters)
```

Names of values and functions start with a lowercase letter. Names of types,
constructors, modules, and components start with an uppercase letter.
Multi-word names are `camelCase` or `PascalCase`.

## Literals

```alder
42            -- Int
3.14          -- Float
True  False   -- Bool
"text"        -- Text
"Hi {name}"   -- Text with interpolation. The expression must be Text.
"a \"quoted\" \{brace} \n"   -- escapes: \" \\ \{ \n \t
[1, 2, 3]     -- List Int
{ x: 1, y: 2 }   -- record
()            -- Unit
```

String interpolation inserts a `Text` only. To insert an `Int`, write
`"Total: {Text.fromInt n}"`.

Inside `{…}` is an ordinary expression, so it may contain string literals
of its own, written as usual without escaping:
`"tags: {Text.join ", " tags}"`.

## Function application

Functions are applied by juxtaposition and are curried. With `add` from
above (a block's leading `let` lines are how `alder eval` takes definitions;
chapter 11):

```alder eval=3
let add : Int -> Int -> Int = \a b -> a + b
add 1 2
```

```alder eval=[2, 3, 4]
let add : Int -> Int -> Int = \a b -> a + b
List.map (add 1) [1, 2, 3]
```

Use parentheses to group. Use `|>` to pipe a value into the last parameter:

```alder eval=1
let todos = [{ title: "a", done: False }, { title: "b", done: True }]
todos
  |> List.filter (\t -> not t.done)
  |> List.length
```

There is no `<|`, no `<<`, no `>>`.

## Lambdas

```alder eval=<function>
\x -> x + 1
```

```alder fragment
-- TODO(compiler): two-parameter lambda applied inline fails to infer (E0003): `(\a b -> a + b) 1 2`
-- is "expected Int, got _"; with a signature or an annotated `let` it checks.
\a b -> a + b
```

## Operators

| Operator | Types | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `+ - * /` | `Int` or `Float` (both sides the same) | arithmetic; `/` on `Int` truncates |
| `%` | `Int` | remainder |
| `++` | `Text` or `List a` | concatenation |
| `== !=` | any type without functions or effects (both sides identical) | equality |
| `< <= > >=` | `Int`, `Float`, `Text`, `Date`, `Time`, payload-less unions | comparison |
| `&& \|\|` | `Bool` | logic, short-circuit |
| `not` | `Bool` | negation (a function, not an operator) |
| `??` | `Maybe a` and `a` | default: `m ?? d` is `d` when `m` is `Nothing` |
| `\|>` | | pipe |

Precedence, highest first: function application; `* / %`; `+ - ++`;
`== != < <= > >=`; `&&`; `||`; `??`; `|>`. There is no user-defined operator.

## Records

```alder eval={ x: 10, y: 0 }
let origin = { x: 0, y: 0 }
let x = origin.x                 -- field access
{ origin | x: x + 10 }           -- copy with fields changed; fields must already exist
```

Record literals are checked against the expected record type. Every field
must be present, and no extra fields are allowed. There is no field punning:
write `{ id: id }`, not `{ id }`.

## Conditionals

```alder eval="done"
let todo = { title: "a", done: True }
if todo.done then "done" else "open"
```

`if` always has an `else`. Both branches have the same type.

## Match

```alder eval=[{ title: "a", done: False }]
let filter = Active
let todos = [{ title: "a", done: False }, { title: "b", done: True }]
match filter {
  All -> todos,
  Active -> List.filter (\t -> not t.done) todos,
  Completed -> List.filter (\t -> t.done) todos,
}
```

Every arm is `pattern -> expression`, separated by commas. A trailing comma
is allowed. `match` must cover every case; there is no wildcard-by-default.

Patterns:

```alder
match m {
  Just x -> x,                 -- constructor with payload
  Nothing -> 0,
}

match shape {
  Circle r -> r * r,
  Rect { w: w, h: h } -> w * h,   -- record pattern, same syntax as a record literal
}

match n {
  0 -> "zero",                 -- literal
  _ -> "other",                -- wildcard, allowed only as the last arm
}

match xs {
  [] -> "empty",
  [x] -> "one",
  [x, ..rest] -> "many",       -- head and tail
}
```

Patterns do not nest more than one level deep, except for records. Match on
the inner value in a second `match`.

## Blocks

A block is a sequence of `let` statements followed by one expression, in
braces. Statements are separated by newlines.

```alder
summary : List Todo -> Text
summary todos = {
  let open = List.filter (\t -> not t.done) todos
  let n = List.length open
  "{Text.fromInt n} open"
}
```

A `let` may carry a type annotation: `let n : Int = List.length open`.

Inside an effect block (a block whose final expression is a `Query` or
`Task`, chapter 7), `let x <- effect` runs the effect and binds its result:

```alder
openCount : Query Int
openCount = {
  let todos <- Db.from Todo |> Db.all
  Query.succeed (Todo.countOpen todos)
}
```

`let x <- ...` is only allowed in a block whose result is a `Query` or
`Task`, and the effect on the right must be of the same kind.

A block is an expression and can appear anywhere an expression can. A
function whose body is a single expression does not need a block.

## Whitespace

Whitespace is not significant except that statements in a block are
separated by newlines. An expression may continue onto the next line
when the line ends with an operator or the next line begins with `|>`,
an operator, or is inside unclosed brackets.

## Reserved words

```
module import type brand where page msg form table capability session login
test let match if then else for in requires
```

The declaration-head words (`module import type page msg form table
capability session login test`) are reserved only at the start of a line
(column 1). Elsewhere they are ordinary names, so `load params session = …`
and `{ form: 1 }` are valid. The remaining words are reserved everywhere.
